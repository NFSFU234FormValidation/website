<Paragraph className="my-4 text-sm">
Here are the standout features and improvements we’ve packed into this beta release:
</Paragraph>

<div className="ml-[100px] block">
<ul className="my-4 list-disc">
    <li className="my-3 text-sm leading-8">
        <strong>Framework Compatibility:</strong> We’ve expanded our support to include modern frontend frameworks like <b>React JS</b> and <b>Vite</b>. You can now integrate our library seamlessly with these popular tools, making your development process even more versatile. 🛠️
    </li>
    <li className="my-3 text-sm leading-8">
        <strong>TypeScript Upgrade:</strong> The core of our library has been upgraded from <b>Vanilla JavaScript</b> to <b>TypeScript</b>. This change enhances code efficiency and makes debugging a breeze. Get ready for a faster and more reliable coding experience! 💨
    </li>
    <li className="my-3 text-sm leading-8">
        <strong>Improved Error Handling:</strong> We’ve introduced the <b>ErrorMessage</b> and <b>ErrorHandler</b> interfaces to provide clearer insights into errors. These interfaces offer detailed messages that can be HTML elements, text, or even null, helping you diagnose and resolve issues more effectively. 📜
    </li>
    <li className="my-3 text-sm leading-8">
        <strong>Revamped Methods:</strong> Our <b>submit</b> and <b>validate</b> methods have been completely redesigned. They now return a <b>Promise</b> that resolves to a <Link href={'/docs/errorMessageInterface'} className="text-blue-500 font-semibold">ErrorMessageInterface</Link>, giving you more detailed feedback on validation results. 🔍
    </li>
    <li className="my-3 text-sm leading-8">
        <strong>Website Enhancements:</strong> We’re also working on improving our website. The current version may have been a bit of a maze, but we’re committed to making it more user-friendly. By the time we release the stable version, the website will be in top shape! 🌐
    </li>
    <li className="text-red-500 text-sm">
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> As we transition to the stable releases, we’ll be renaming the <b>js-required</b> class and <b>jsSubmit</b> id to <b>nfsfu234-fv-required</b> and <b>nfsfu234-fv-form</b> respectively. This change is part of our effort to maintain a clean and consistent naming convention. 📋
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
